# Setting Up Environment

In this lab we will be using Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning to create and deploy machine learning models. We will need to have an instance of Watson Studio and an instance of Watson Machine Learning, as well as a cloud object storage instance where our artifacts/assets get stored.

## Prerequisites

- An IBM Cloud ID

## Instructions
